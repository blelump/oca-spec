# OCA Ecosystem Tour

There are many additional concepts defined on top of OCA that on their own require further explanation. Thus, the OCA Ecosystem emerged as an umbrella for the building blocks. It bounds all the basic concepts that play important role in this ecosystem. Around the concepts, components are defined that come along with the reference implementation.

The OCA Ecosystem consists of the following components:

- [OCA Parser](/ecosystem/oca-parser) – allows to define [ OCA Bundles ](/ecosystem/oca-bundle) in a common format (currently from XLS);
- [OCA Browser](/ecosystem/oca-browser) – renders [ OCA Bundle ](/ecosystem/oca-bundle) preview in a WEB browser;
- [OCA Repository](/ecosystem/oca-repository) – manages [ OCA Bundles ](/ecosystem/oca-bundle);
- [OCA Data Vault](/ecosystem/oca-data-vault) – stores [ OCA Bundle ](/ecosystem/oca-bundle) related assets and code tables;
- [OCA Validator](/ecosystem/oca-validator) – validates data record against [ OCA Bundle ](/ecosystem/oca-bundle).

Refer also to the [Basic Concepts](/specification/#basic-concepts) section of the specification.
